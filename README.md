- There are many modern people who have difficulty waking up early in the morning due to overtime and studying. There are various alarm applications on the market, but they provide only fragmentary functions such as playing loud sounds. This has limitations in practically waking up users.

- Also, office workers and students don't have enough time to exercise. It's good to stretch from time to time, but many people don't do it because it's easy to forget and troublesome.

The functions in the system are as follows:

1. You can set, modify, and delete alarms.
2. When the alarm goes off, the user presses the start button to turn off the alarm by recognizing the motion (squat, lunge, triangle).
3. If the user's behavior is incorrect or the alarm is not turned off, reset the alarm automatically after 10 minutes.
